## Hi there, Thiago here!ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm Brazilian from the interior of the state of Minas Gerais, Southeast region of the country.

Focused on learning Front-end development technology in my spare time, of course dividing this time to pay attention to my family.

Seeking to absorb as much knowledge as possible and get a job in the area, I really admire the profession and what is possible to create using the imagination, in reality do not limit it, what limits is the knowledge and mastery of languages.

Believe in your potential and move on, giving up is not an option for those who really have a solid goal, because they know that just by persisting in a dream it can become possible.
